Users spend 90% of their time interacting with applications after they load, but most developers just focus on speeding up the initial load.

In this talk we will go beyond initial loading strategies, and make future navigation feel instant by predicting what users might click on next and loading those parts ahead of time.

We will use real applications to see how to implement speculative loading techniques and how you can measure the improvement with soft navigation's largest contentful paint (LCP).

Finally we will demonstrate how you can convert a 2 second navigation into less than 100 milliseconds using the Intersection Observer API, the Angular router and HTML link tags.
