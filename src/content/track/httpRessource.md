With the brand-new httpResource, Angular provides us with a way to fetch data within the reactive, Signal-based data flow. In this session, we will explore all the details of this groundbreaking building block.

First, we will migrate an existing data access logic based on HttpClient to httpResource and discuss how it integrates into our architecture and the reactive graph. Next, we will explore advanced capabilities, such as tracking progress (reportProgress), integrating schema validation (parse), and working with binary data as well as data formats beyond JSON. In addition to error-handling strategies, this session will also highlight the limitations of httpResource.

By the end, you will know how to effectively leverage the new httpResource in your Signal-based Angular applications.
