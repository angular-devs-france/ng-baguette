name: "Quo vadis State Management?"
description: "
With the introduction of Signals, Angular has made a strong statement toward state management. Using a Signal as a container for state, along with functions like computed, resource, and others, raises the big question of whether there’s still a need for specialized libraries like NgRx.

In my talk, I’ll explore this question and demonstrate how far you can go with native tools and where you may hit limitations, making a shift to a solution like the NgRx Signal Store worthwhile.
